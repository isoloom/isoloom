# Changelog

## 0.7.0

### New targets and commands
- `hybrid` target: containers and VMs on the same networks.
- `isoloom run` and `isoloom down`: generate a target and bring it up or tear it down.

### Cloud (AWS / Azure)
- `cloud-vm` on AWS: one VM per machine, machines on several networks, Windows machines, and environment-level `provision:` (Ansible from a controller).
- Terraform expressions are interpolated in set-up commands (a MAC lookup was emitted literally).
- AWS defaults are Free Tier eligible (t3.small, c7i-flex.large, m7i-flex.large).
- Azure defaults to Sweden Central with v6 AMD sizes (D2als_v6, D2as_v6, D4as_v6).
- Cloud outputs copy the project as a tar archive (executable bits preserved) and stop on the first failed step.

### New machine fields
- `arch` (amd64 / arm64): pin a machine's CPU architecture; the Compose platform, the Vagrant box architecture and the Kubernetes node selector all follow it.
- `privileged`: a container that needs kernel access.
- `read_only`: a read-only root filesystem (hardening).
- `tmpfs` and `shm_size`: memory-backed mounts.
- `dns`: resolver, search domains and domain name.

### Fixes
- Vagrant: pin `box_architecture` only for arm64, not the amd64 default, so older boxes without architecture metadata (the GOAD boxes) stop failing `vagrant up`.
- Generated Terraform modules declare a `local` backend, so the state path is honored.
- WinRM over SSL for Windows boxes that need it.
- Keep Windows machines out of the Linux `/etc/hosts` (AD realm joins resolve through the domain controller).
- VMs get 900s to boot (Windows Server 2025 first boot exceeds 600s).
- `isoloom check` validates before checking; serialization errors are surfaced; the CIDR scan is bounded.
- `import vagrant` runs its recorder from a private per-run temp dir.

### Coverage
- Docker Compose and Vagrant coverage raised through the new machine fields; Vagrant Windows boxes and WinRM marked done.
